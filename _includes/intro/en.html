<p>OpenStreetMap is the free and editable map of the world, created and maintained by a huge international community. Mapbox Streets, our customizable map layer of streets, buildings, and places from all around the world, is powered by open data from OpenStreetMap. Anybody can create an account and start editing on <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap.org</a> within minutes.</p>

<p>Our data team updates OpenStreetMap based on quality analysis and customer feedback. Our principle is <em><a href="https://www.mapbox.com/blog/osm-mapping-guide/">to work in the open</a></em>. You are welcome to join <a href="https://github.com/mapbox/mapping/issues">one of our open mapping projects over on the issue queue</a> and use these best practice mapping guides.</p>

<p>These mapping guides are primarily maintained and used by the data team at Mapbox for various mapping projects and in onboarding new team members. <i><a href="https://www.mapbox.com/blog/redesigned-osm-mapping-guides/"> These guides are licensed under Public Domain (CC0)</a></i></p>
