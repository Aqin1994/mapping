Navigational devices help people to get from one place to the other. The operation of such devices are largely dependent on quality of the underlying map data. Essentially this means the map data must consist of marked turn lanes, tagged one-ways roads, turn restrictions and so on. OpenStreetMap data includes all kinds of information to provide guidance in navigational devices by many modes including car, bicycle, foot and horse. In order to improve this data on OpenStreetMap, comprehensive mapping of turn lanes, turn restrictions, speed limits and oneways must be carried out. 

This is an effort to develop guidelines to map the different components which will ultimately help build a great navigational engine. Let's dive in:
