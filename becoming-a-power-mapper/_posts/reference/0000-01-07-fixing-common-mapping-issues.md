title: Fixing common mapping issues
---

Identifying common mistakes made by beginner mappers and knowing how to fix them is important to improve the quality of the map. If you spot something which needs fixing, send a friendly message on the users' changeset on what was wrong and how it could be fixed. You can use this guide as a reference.

|**Overlapping ways** | [![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11504548/7966913/a0edc5a6-09ec-11e5-9583-fd510c0ab6fd.png)](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11504548/7966913/a0edc5a6-09ec-11e5-9583-fd510c0ab6fd.png)  A linear way goes over itself or another way with the exact same tags (note the arrows on the selected way) | Run`shift+V` >select the detection from `Overlapping ways`>Delete the overlapping way, make sure there are no gaps or missing pieces left behind. | You can use the [JOSM validator](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/JOSM/Validator) to detect these issues.|
|**Untagged Ways**|[![untagged](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6770741/11389187/c0354348-9363-11e5-9441-5c9833d8b4b2.gif)](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6770741/11389187/c0354348-9363-11e5-9441-5c9833d8b4b2.gif) Ways with no tags on them| Run `shift+v` > select the detection from `Untagged ways`> Select the ways and add appropriate highway tags| OSM wiki on [highway](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:highway)|
|**Crossing ways**|![crossing_way1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13744156/36120674-f4338f9c-1011-11e8-84b0-17b2bed75ade.png) These are ways (with highway/railway/waterway tags) that crosses in same layer with no crossing/intersecting node|Run `shift+V` > Select the detection from `Crossing ways`> Select the crossing ways>`shift+I` to add the intersecting node| Refer to this [guide](https://www.mapbox.com/mapping/becoming-a-power-mapper/josm-shortcuts/) for JOSM shortcuts.|
|**Self-intersecting ways**|![ ](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13744156/36121254-96ca175c-1013-11e8-99d3-b8cbd36a4006.png) A way intersects itself, possibly sharing same nodes.|Run `shift+V` > Select the detection from `Crossing ways`> Select the self intersecting way>Split (`P`) and delete the segment which is intersecting the highway||
|**Way end node near other highway**|![way end](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13744156/36121644-d783bb94-1014-11e8-8871-b8e30e212f99.png) Nodes which ends near to other highways| Run `shift+V` > Select the detection from `Way end node near other highway`> Select the node and press `shift+J` to connect it.||
| **Add `layer=1` for bridges**|[![bridgefilter](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6770741/11365662/e2c2b5bc-92cd-11e5-830d-2a165b896181.gif)](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6770741/11365662/e2c2b5bc-92cd-11e5-830d-2a165b896181.gif)If there is a lot bridges without `layer=1` tag, you can filter bridges easily.|Go to every bridge and look into imagery for it's layers (layer=1, layer=2 etc) and add |OSM Wiki on [bridge](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:bridge)|
|**Overlapping buildings**|[![screen shot 2015-11-24 at 5 50 20 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6770741/11366588/222087f6-92d4-11e5-8a45-2189e3b2e961.png)](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6770741/11366588/222087f6-92d4-11e5-8a45-2189e3b2e961.png) Buildings which are overlapping, should be separated | Run Validator and separate manually, use 'Q' to orthogonalise it| Check OSM wiki on [building](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Buildings) for more information.|
|**Add junction=roundabout**|[![junction](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6770741/11375904/cd5a8336-9303-11e5-8cb3-2ea99a610142.gif)](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6770741/11375904/cd5a8336-9303-11e5-8cb3-2ea99a610142.gif)|Add `junction=roundabout` for circle| OSM Wiki for [roundabout](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:junction%3Droundabout)|
|**Split bridge at exact location**|[![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1152236/7830938/6a645932-046f-11e5-8f6b-560054ac584c.png)](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1152236/7830938/6a645932-046f-11e5-8f6b-560054ac584c.png) Should split bridge exactly to match imagery| Switch between Bing/Mapbox to clear confusion| OSM wiki on [bridge](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:bridge)|

|**Crossing waterways/highways**|[![crossingwater](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6770741/11389332/779fd81c-9365-11e5-9467-7cdd96b3a2a3.gif)](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6770741/11389332/779fd81c-9365-11e5-9467-7cdd96b3a2a3.gif)| Run `shift+v` to get all crossing waterways and highways| Add `layer=1` to bridges to solve the issue|[bridge](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:bridge)|
|**Missing highway names**|[![missingnames](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6770741/11389598/44b162d8-9368-11e5-8b53-7228fd992ebc.gif)](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6770741/11389598/44b162d8-9368-11e5-8b53-7228fd992ebc.gif) The names of highways should be added using recent TIGER (Only for USA) data| Steps to add predefined [imagery sources](https://josm.openstreetmap.de/wiki/Help/Preferences/Imagery) in JOSM | OSM wiki on [TIGER](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/TIGER)| 
|**Abbreviated road names**|[![abbreviated](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6770741/11389977/8352e5a4-936b-11e5-9b0c-c3b01e9e7857.gif)](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6770741/11389977/8352e5a4-936b-11e5-9b0c-c3b01e9e7857.gif)| Do not abbreviate street names, write full name| E.g: Boulevard as Blvd, Street as St, Court as Ct, Drive as Dr etc|

|**Possibility to improve alignment**|[![improvement](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6770741/11390603/e4807660-9371-11e5-94e8-fabf25e62fa4.gif)](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6770741/11390603/e4807660-9371-11e5-94e8-fabf25e62fa4.gif)| Use `W` to align the lines/polygons to the imagery| |
