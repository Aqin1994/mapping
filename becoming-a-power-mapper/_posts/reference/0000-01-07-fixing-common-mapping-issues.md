title: Fixing common mapping issues
---

Identifying common mistakes made by mappers for road network and knowing how to fix them is important to improve the quality of the map. If you spot mistakes which needs major fixing, send a friendly message on the users' changeset on what is wrong and how it could be fixed. You can use this guide as a reference while fixing data errors in JOSM.

### Highway errors

| Issue | Whats wrong | How to fix it | Tips |
| ----- |------------ | ------------- | ---- |
|**Overlapping ways** | [![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11504548/7966913/a0edc5a6-09ec-11e5-9583-fd510c0ab6fd.png)](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11504548/7966913/a0edc5a6-09ec-11e5-9583-fd510c0ab6fd.png)  A highway which run over itself or another way with the exact same road classification. (Note the arrows on the selected way) | Run validator `shift+V` —> Among validator errors/warnings select `Overlapping ways` —> Delete the overlapping way, make sure there are no gaps or missing pieces left behind. | 
|**Untagged Ways**|[![untagged](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6770741/11389187/c0354348-9363-11e5-9441-5c9833d8b4b2.gif)](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6770741/11389187/c0354348-9363-11e5-9441-5c9833d8b4b2.gif) Ways with no tags associated with the geometry | Run validator `shift+V` —> Among validator errors/warnings select `Untagged ways` —> Select individual ways and add appropriate highway tags| Refer OpenStreetMap wiki on [highway tagging schema](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:highway)|
|**Crossing ways**|![crossing_way1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13744156/36120674-f4338f9c-1011-11e8-84b0-17b2bed75ade.png) The ways (with highway/railway/waterway tags) that crosses in same [layer](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:layer) with no crossing/intersecting node | Run validator `shift+V` —> Among validator errors/warnings select `Crossing ways` —> `shift+I` to add the intersecting node | Install [`utilsplugin2`](https://www.mapbox.com/mapping/mapping-with-josm/#plugins) to get advanced intersection modeling features. Refer to this [guide](https://www.mapbox.com/mapping/becoming-a-power-mapper/josm-shortcuts/) for JOSM shortcuts.|
|**Self-intersecting ways**|![ ](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13744156/36121254-96ca175c-1013-11e8-99d3-b8cbd36a4006.png) A highway which intersects itself, possibly sharing same nodes at intersection.| Run validator `shift+V` —> Among validator errors/warnings select `Self-intersecting way` —> Split using shortcut (`P`) at the intersection (common node) and delete the segment which is intersecting the highway||
|**Way end node near other highway**|![way end](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13744156/36121644-d783bb94-1014-11e8-8871-b8e30e212f99.png) A highway node which ends near to other highways but dont connect each other.| Run validator `shift+V` —> Among validator errors/warnings select `Way end node near other highway` —> Select individual node and press `shift+J` to form the connection.||
| **Add `layer=1` for bridges**|[![bridgefilter](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6770741/11365662/e2c2b5bc-92cd-11e5-830d-2a165b896181.gif)](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6770741/11365662/e2c2b5bc-92cd-11e5-830d-2a165b896181.gif)If there is a lot bridges without `layer=1` tag, you can filter bridges easily.|Go to every bridge and look into imagery for it's layers (layer=1, layer=2 etc) and add |OSM Wiki on [bridge](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:bridge)|
|**Add junction=roundabout**|[![junction](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6770741/11375904/cd5a8336-9303-11e5-8cb3-2ea99a610142.gif)](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6770741/11375904/cd5a8336-9303-11e5-8cb3-2ea99a610142.gif)|Add `junction=roundabout` for circle| OSM Wiki for [roundabout](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:junction%3Droundabout)|
|**Possibility to improve alignment**|[![improvement](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6770741/11390603/e4807660-9371-11e5-94e8-fabf25e62fa4.gif)](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6770741/11390603/e4807660-9371-11e5-94e8-fabf25e62fa4.gif)| Use `W` to align the lines/polygons to the imagery| |

### Non-Highway errors

|**Overlapping buildings**|[![screen shot 2015-11-24 at 5 50 20 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6770741/11366588/222087f6-92d4-11e5-8a45-2189e3b2e961.png)](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6770741/11366588/222087f6-92d4-11e5-8a45-2189e3b2e961.png) Buildings which are overlapping, should be separated | Run Validator and separate manually, use 'Q' to orthogonalise it| Check OSM wiki on [building](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Buildings) for more information.|
|**Split bridge at exact location**|[![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1152236/7830938/6a645932-046f-11e5-8f6b-560054ac584c.png)](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1152236/7830938/6a645932-046f-11e5-8f6b-560054ac584c.png) Should split bridge exactly to match imagery| Switch between Bing/Mapbox to clear confusion| OSM wiki on [bridge](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:bridge)|

|**Missing highway names**|[![missingnames](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6770741/11389598/44b162d8-9368-11e5-8b53-7228fd992ebc.gif)](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6770741/11389598/44b162d8-9368-11e5-8b53-7228fd992ebc.gif) The names of highways should be added using recent TIGER (Only for USA) data| Steps to add predefined [imagery sources](https://josm.openstreetmap.de/wiki/Help/Preferences/Imagery) in JOSM | OSM wiki on [TIGER](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/TIGER)| 
|**Abbreviated road names**|[![abbreviated](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6770741/11389977/8352e5a4-936b-11e5-9b0c-c3b01e9e7857.gif)](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6770741/11389977/8352e5a4-936b-11e5-9b0c-c3b01e9e7857.gif)| Do not abbreviate street names, write full name| E.g: Boulevard as Blvd, Street as St, Court as Ct, Drive as Dr etc|
