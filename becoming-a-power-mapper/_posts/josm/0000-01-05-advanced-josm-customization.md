title: Advanced JOSM customization

Hidden settings in JOSM can be configured directly from the advanced preferences panel. This also gives you access to export and import your configuration profiles.

The panel is hidden by default and is shown as the last option when `Expert mode` is enabled.

**Note** JOSM will need  to be restarted for any changes to take effect.
