### Buildings:

* For selecting intersecting buildings and combining them use, `I and Shift+J`
* Alternatively, the mapper can use the `Combine LA buildings` tool.
* In extrusion mode, do `control+command` to do redraw/reshape buildings for irregularly shaped buildings
* In extrusion mode, add four nodes in a segment and then `control+command`, and drag the middle segment for pyramidal structures in buildings
* Double tap A to draw complicated buildings and do not use the building plugin.
* For buildings with numerous extrusions: Draw a building> draw an extrusion> copy paste for all the extrusions> add intersecting nodes (shift+I)> join (shift+J)
* For buildings sharing the same wall, draw buildings using B and then select intersecting nodes and then join (J) and/or join way to node (N)
* Use terracer plugin for multiple same shaped buildings sharing the same wall (shortcut shift+T)
* Use resize tool `control+alt` to resize shapes e.g circles

**Validation buildings**
* Run the validator
* Select all to highlight all the buildings to review


### Roads

* Install and use Fast draw plugin (shortcut: shift+F)
* Press down arrow to simplify way, up arrow to add more complexity and then `enter`
* `Q` to simplify straight segments of roads
* Shortcuts to tag each type of road classification `Preferences > customize the icons in the toolbar > Presets > highways/ features that require shortcut > highways/streets > select the road you want to add as shortcut > right click on the shortcut and add a shortcut`
