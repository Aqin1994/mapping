#JOSM Sessions

JOSM sessions allows you to pre-load various layers within JOSM similar most GIS software (in QGIS we call it a project file). More information about using JOSM session [here](https://github.com/mapbox/mapping/wiki/Saving-and-loading-a-JOSM-session)

Within this directory are several session configuration files (`.jos`) we use.
